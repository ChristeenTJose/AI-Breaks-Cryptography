## Results and Updates: 
### Caesar Cipher:
#### Model used: Shallow Neural Network
All models have 1 input layer, 1 hidden layer and 1 output layer
The input and output layers have 26 units each.
3 different shallow neural networks were considered,depending on the number of units in hidden layer:
  * Model 1: Hidden layer with 13 units
    * Number of trainable parameters: 1,417

Number of Non-trainable parameters: 0
   
  * Model 2: Hidden layer with 26 units
  * Modle 3: Hidden layer with 39 units
